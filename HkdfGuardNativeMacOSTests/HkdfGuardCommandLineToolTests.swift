/// Exercises the actual `hkdfguard-v1-initialize` command-line tool
/// (`../hkdfguard-v1-initialize`) as a real, separate process — not the
/// `hkdfguard_wrap_dek` C ABI function it calls internally, which every
/// other test in this suite already covers directly. This is the one
/// place that answers "does the tool a real caller runs actually work,
/// end to end": argument parsing, file I/O (permissions, `--force`
/// overwrite/secure-delete), exit codes, and — the scenario this file
/// exists for — that a DEK wrapped by that separate process can be
/// recovered by *application code* (the library, called directly here the
/// same way a consuming app would) via `hkdfguard_unwrap_dek`.
///
/// That last point is confirmed to work correctly (byte-for-byte, proven
/// below) but is NOT free of ceremony: the CLI tool and this test host are
/// two differently-signed binaries, and the Secure Enclave key the CLI
/// creates is persisted as an ordinary keychain item with no shared
/// `kSecAttrAccessGroup` (see the comment in
/// HkdfGuardNativeMacOS.entitlements on why not). Its default ACL
/// therefore trusts exactly the creating binary's code signature, or
/// falls back to an interactive macOS keychain-access prompt for anyone
/// else — confirmed directly in the system log (`log show`) while
/// developing this suite:
///
///   securityd: displaying keychain prompt for .../xctest(59175);
///   ACL: ThresholdAclSubject(1 of 2)
///     [CodeSignatureAclSubject[path: .../hkdfguard-v1-initialize]]
///     [KeychainPromptAclSubject(desc: com.hkdfguard.tests.cli.roundtrip.1)]
///
/// The first time this test host (as a new, not-yet-approved requesting
/// identity) reads a keychain item the CLI created, that prompt appears
/// and blocks until a human clicks it — observed taking over half an hour
/// in an unattended run. Once approved, that identity seems to be trusted
/// going forward: three more CLI→app round trips in the same run
/// afterward completed in single-digit seconds each, not the same long
/// wait. See `interactiveKeychainAccessEnabled` below for how the affected
/// tests are gated because of this.
///
/// This is not just a test-environment quirk: it's the same prompt a real
/// differently-signed consuming application would hit in production
/// unwrapping a DEK the CLI provisioned, absent a shared keychain-access-
/// group entitlement between them.
///
/// Separately: the *first* CLI subprocess launch after a freshly built
/// binary was also observed to take several seconds longer than later
/// launches — Gatekeeper's first-launch check, most likely — independent
/// of the keychain-prompt issue above. `toolsBuilt`
/// below deliberately builds the tool once, up front, outside of any
/// individual test's timing, so that one-time cost doesn't land on
/// whichever test happens to run first.
///
/// `.serialized` for the same Secure Enclave/SEP concurrency reason as
/// `HkdfGuardNativeMacOSWrapUnwrapTests`. Every test that actually
/// exercises the CLI's wrap path is additionally gated on
/// `SecureEnclave.isAvailable` — see `secureEnclaveAvailableComment` below
/// — so this suite degrades gracefully to just its pure argument-handling
/// tests (`cliRejects*`, `cliPrintsUsageOnHelp`) on a CI/VM runner with no
/// real Secure Enclave, rather than failing outright.
