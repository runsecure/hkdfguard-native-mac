#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One-time developer setup: provisions a persistent Secure Enclave KEK in
# the *data-protection* keychain (not the legacy login keychain), under a
# fixed, well-known service name, so hosted unit tests
# (HkdfGuardNativeMacOSTests-Hosted / HkdfGuardNativeMacOSTestHost.app) have
# an already-provisioned key to test against without every run needing to
# provision one itself.
#
# What "already imported" means here: this KEK's opaque data representation
# is stored as a real keychain item under the TEST-ONLY
# com.hkdfguard.tests.keys access group -- the same way production
# provisioning would leave it, but never in the production
# com.hkdfguard.keys group, which the unhardened test host must not share -- there
# is no separate "import" step or key file; provisioning *is* the import,
# because the private key material never leaves the Secure Enclave to begin
# with (see HkdfGuardNativeMacOS.swift). This script just runs
# that provisioning once, signed, so it doesn't have to happen inside every
# test invocation.
#
# How: builds the `hkdfguard-v1-initialize-app` target (the bundled,
# Team-signed, hardened-runtime build of the CLI; in Debug, entitled for
# com.hkdfguard.tests.keys -- see HkdfGuardNativeMacOS.xcodeproj and
# hkdfguard-v1-initialize/hkdfguard-v1-initialize.tests.entitlements) and runs its
# `provision` command once. That entitlement is what puts the KEK in the
# data-protection keychain instead of the legacy one (see "Keychain modes"
# in README.md) -- running the bare SwiftPM CLI here would provision into
# the *legacy* keychain instead, which is not what this script is for.
#
# Idempotent: hkdfguard_create_kek (what `provision` calls) is a no-op if
# the KEK already exists, so re-running this script is always safe and
# leaves the same KEK in place.
#
# Requirements (one-time, per developer machine, not handled by this
# script): this Mac must be registered as a device in the Apple developer
# account so Xcode can mint a Mac App Development provisioning profile for
# the entitled app targets -- without a profile, a process requesting
# keychain-access-groups is killed by AMFI at launch, entitlement or not.
# See README.md's "Tests" section for the exact steps. This script detects
# that failure and prints the same instructions rather than a raw
# xcodebuild error dump.
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup-hosted-test-kek.sh                # provisions the default fixture service
#   ./setup-hosted-test-kek.sh --service-name com.example.my.fixture

error: this Mac (or its App ID) is not yet set up for automatic
provisioning, so the entitled hkdfguard-v1-initialize-app target cannot be
signed. This is a one-time, per-developer-machine step this script cannot
do for you:

  1. Find this Mac's Provisioning UDID:
       system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'Provisioning UDID'
  2. Register it as a device: developer.apple.com -> Certificates,
     Identifiers & Profiles -> Devices -> + -> macOS -> paste the UDID.
     (Or open the project in Xcode, select the HkdfGuardNativeMacOSTestHost or
     hkdfguard-v1-initialize-app target's Signing & Capabilities tab --
     Xcode offers to register the device for you.)
  3. Re-run this script.
